PROBLEM: Write a program to determine whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
  input: three integers representing three sides of a trianges
  output: string - isosceles, equilateral, scalene

EXAMPLES/RULES
  Equal sides = equilateral
  two sides the same = isosceles
  all three different = scalene
  sum of any two sides cannot be less than/equal to third side
  no side can be zero or less than zero

  Invalid triangles raise an Argument error

DATA STRUCTURES
Arrays
splat operator

Triangle class
  #initialize
    - accepts three integer args
    - raises ArgumentError if sides are invalid
  #kind
    - returns proper string

  HELPER METHODS
  
  #valid_sides?
    The sum of any two sides is greater than the third side
    


ALGORITHM

  class Triangle
  #initialize(*sides)
    INIT sides arr
    RAISE ArgumentError unless sides.valid?
  
  #kind
    case statement with #uniq
    1 is equilateral
    2 is isosceles
    3 is scalene

  #valid?
    ALL sides are greater than zero AND
