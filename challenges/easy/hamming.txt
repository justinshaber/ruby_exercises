PROBLEM
  Compute the Hamming distance between two strands of DNA.
  Iterate simultaneously through two strings, counting the number of differences between them.

  INPUT:
    two strings
  OUTPUT:
    an integer

EXAMPLES
  EXPLICIT RULES
    - count differences between two strings
    - if strings are different lengths, only iterate the length of the shorter string
  IMPLICIT RULES
    - strings are not modified
    - empty strings returns 0

DATA STRUCTURES
  - Arrays
  - each_char (with index?)

ALGORITHM
  DNA Class
    - accepts one string as an argument upon initialization
  DNA#hamming_distance
    - called by an instance of DNA
    - accepts one string as an argument
    - returns an integer
