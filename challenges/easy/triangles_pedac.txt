PROBLEM
Write a program to determine whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
  - An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.
  - An isosceles triangle has exactly two sides of the same length.
  - A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.
  - For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides must be of length > 0
    - length can be float or integer
  - the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.


  INPUT:
    3 integers - 3 parameters, or an array
  OUTPUT
    string - "isosceles", "scalene", "equilateral"

EXAMPLES
  Triangle.new(int1, int2, int3)
  Triangle#kind => string
  constructor
    => ArgumentError if:
      - any side is <= 0
      - the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

DATA STRUCTURES
  Array

ALGORITHM
  OVERVIEW:
      Triangle class
        - constructor
        - #kind method
  Constructor
    - accepts three arguments
    - puts them into an array
    - verifies the three passed arguments are valid
      - all greater than 0
      - sum of an two is greater than the third
  - Triangle#kind
    call Array.uniq.size
      if 3 => "scalene"
      if 2 => "isosceles"
      if 1 => "equilateral"
