PROBLEM
  OVERVIEW: Write a program that takes a list of possible anagrams and a word, and returns a new list containing anagrams of the given word.

  INPUT: Array of strings
  OUTPUT: Array of strings that are anagrams of the comparison word.

EXAMPLES:
  RULES
    - anagram uses the exact same letters the exact amount of times.
    - case agnostic

DATA STRUCTURES
  - Hash to determine number of occurances of a letters

ALGORITHM
  - Anagram Class
    - constructor
      accepts a single string as an argument
    - Anagram#match
      - accepts an array as an argument
      - iterates through the passed array
        - if current word is an anagram of comparison word, add it to results array
      - return results array

  - anagram?
    - get a list of each unique character in the word
    - create a hash with the letter as key, number as value
