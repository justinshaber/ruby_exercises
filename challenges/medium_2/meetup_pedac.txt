  Arrays

ALGORITHM
  Start at the first day of the month
  Iterate from 1-7 until we find the correct day of the week
    step by 7 collecting all relevant days
    stop iteration when date is invalid
  Helper method
    case statement
    Return the correct date



  Meetup#new(year, month)
    INIT year
    INIT month
    INIT results arr

  Meetup#Day(weekday, descriptor)
    weekday_int = convert_weekday
    COUNTER = 0
    LOOP
      IF CORRECT DAY OF WEEK
        step by 7 to collect each day
      ELSE
        counter += 1
