PROBLEM
  OVERVIEW: Write a program that takes a takes a string, iterates through an array of strings, and returns a new array with strings that are an anagram of the given word.
  INPUT: a string and an array
  OUTPUT: a new array with anagrams of the given word

EXAMPLES
  RULES
    - no matches returns []
    - identical word is not an anagram
    - case insensitive
  EXPLICIT METHODS
    ANAGRAM#initialize
      - accepts one string argument
      - initializes instance variable referencing passed string
    ANAGRAM#match
      - returns a new array with matches
  HELPER METHODS
    ANAGRAM#anagram?
      - verifies if a word is an anagram of a given word

DATA STRUCTURES
  Hash to keep a count of each letter

ALGORTHIM
  #initialize
    INITIALIZE lowercase string
    INITIALIZE instance var that references anagram hash Key (call method here)
  #match
    SELECT
      ITERATE through passed array
        SELECT if
          - lowercased word is an anagram
          - lowercased word is not same as og_word

  #verify
    COMPARE HASHES
  #hash
    CREATE a Hash
      - keys will be uniq chars
      - values will be an integer representing occurances of the char
    ITERATE through each char
    HASH[char] += 1
