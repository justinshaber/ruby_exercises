PROBLEM
  Create a data strcucture that has the behavior of a 'set'. The actual internal implementation of how the set works is not important.

EXAMPLES/RULES
  There are only numbers in a set
  CustomSet
    #empty? - returns boolean true/false if set contains integers or not
    #contains? - returns t/f
    #subset? - t/f if calling object is a subset of the passed argument
    #eql? - tests if two CustomSet objects contain the same integers
      - multiples don't matter e.g. [1,2,2,1] == [1,2] == [2,1]
      - okay if they are different instances
    #add - add the passed arg to the calling set
      if set already contains value, doesn't add another
    #intersection 
      - iterates through calling set
      - returns a new set with values that appear in set passed as argument
    #difference
      - iterates through calling set
      - returns a new set with values that don't appear in set passed as argument
    #union
      - iterates through a calling set
      - returns a new set with all unique values from calling/passed sets

    #disjoint? - t/f if ... ????
