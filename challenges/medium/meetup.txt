PROBLEM
    OVERVIEW
      - Write a program that takes a Month, Year, Day of the Week, and descriptor and returns the date of the meetup.

    INPUT:
      constructor - (Year, Month) in integers
      #day - (Day of the week, descriptor) - both strings

    OUTPUT
      #day - a new date object
        - Date.civil(year, month, day) - in integers

  EXAMPLES/RULES
    Strings are case insensitive
    Descriptors - First, Second, third, fourth, fifth, last, teenth
    Teenth - there are 7 teenths in a month.
    If 5th day does not work, return nil
  
  ALGORITHM
    Date#cwday - Returns the day of calendar week (1-7, Monday is 1)
    Date#valid_date?(year,month,day)

    Cycle through each day of the month
      - Go until date is not valid
      - Put each '[week]day' in an array
    Get the correct day.
